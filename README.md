This is a tool to read .eml files and extract data specific to a client's needs.
One could change the regex details to find the correct data
Changing the output would choose what was done with the data
The code searches for image file names in PixieSet emails and extracts them with the customers details.
The file names are then used to find the actual image files and move them to a folder to be processed 
for printing. Addresses and logs are included in the output.

Note: This code is probably unstable and my first python project
